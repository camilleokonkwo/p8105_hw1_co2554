Letâ€™s load up the `moderndive` library and open the `early_weather_data`
dataset.

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

# Problem 1

The `early_january_weather` dataset contains weather statistics between
01/01/2013-01/15/2013 at EWR (`origin`). Every hour, the `temp`, `dewp`,
`humid`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`, `pressure`, and `visib`
are noted. There are 358 rows and 15 columns, and the average
temperature during this time is 39.5821229.
