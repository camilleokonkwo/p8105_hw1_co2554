Let's load up the `moderndive` library and open the `early_weather_data` dataset. 

```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

# Problem 1

The `early_january_weather` dataset contains weather statistics between 01/01/2013-01/15/2013 at EWR (`origin`). Every hour, the `temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`, `pressure`, and `visib` are noted. There are   `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns, and the average temperature during this time is `r mean(early_january_weather[["temp"]])`.
